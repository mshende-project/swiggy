##Food-Ordering-App
This repository contains all the learnings and notes I created while learning React JS.

##Tech - Stack
1. Frontend Library: React JS
2. Styling: Tailwind CSS
3. Database: Firebase
4. Bundler: Parcel
5. Authentication: Firebase-Auth
6. State Management: Redux Toolkit

##Working of project
1. We fetch the restaurants of your city from Swiggy API, getting the live data.
2. Display them with Area name, Cuisines Category and Ratings.
3. Search Restaurants by Name.
4. For any restaurant, you can checkout all the different type of dishes available with details and prices per quantity.
5. Add to cart
6. Authenticate yourself
7. Place Order.

##Improvements to make
1. Not responsive for Mobile phones
2. Cart data is not stored anywhere, it should be in local storage for not logged in users to avoid losing on refresh page.

##How to run on your local
1. Clone the repository
2. Run npm init
3. Run npm start.
